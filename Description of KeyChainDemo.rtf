\f0\fs24 \cf0 Description of the KeyChain - demo program\
\
This example shows a way how to use the MonoTouch.Dialog and KeyChainHelper utilities. So you can create and delete login-accounts, whereby your login-data will be saved in a simple textile named accdata.txt which will be created at the first use of the save-function in this example. Your password will be stored encrypted in a system internal way by using the KeyChainHelper methods SetPassword, GetPassword and DeletePassword. The login-name and the URL will be used for identification of the password. For the iPhone specific GUI the MonoTouch.Dialog utility was used. In this state of the example your login will not be executed, there only will be opened the entered URL in a HTML-Element. The HTML-Element needs the prefix "http://" to find the given address and so there is a checking for this and it will be inserted if it is not set. So you can enter a URL in the common style starting with "www".  }
